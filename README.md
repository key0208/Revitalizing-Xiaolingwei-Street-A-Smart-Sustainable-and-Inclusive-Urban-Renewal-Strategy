Project Title: Revitalizing Xiaolingwei Street: A Smart, Sustainable, and Inclusive Urban Renewal Strategy

This is a Project about Urban Regeneration that I did when I was pursuing my first master's degree - Master of Landscape Architecture at Nanjing Agricultural University.

This project presents a comprehensive urban renewal strategy for Xiaolingwei Street in Nanjing, China. Through in-depth analysis, three major challenges are identified: garbage and oil pollution, a deserted commercial complex, and chaotic traffic. Based on spatial diagnostics, historical development, and crowd aggregation patterns, the proposal introduces three integrated strategies: Industrial Equality, Climate Block, and Smart Transportation. Key interventions include optimizing waste logistics, revitalizing Jiuyue Square with diverse retail and entertainment offerings, creating a walkable green space network, implementing multi-level traffic infrastructure, and enhancing public transit systems with real-time digital platforms. The project aims to transform Xiaolingwei into a cleaner, more accessible, and vibrant urban district.

The project not only focuses on the transformation of physical Spaces but also incorporates multi-dimensional data analysis (GIS, POI, traffic flow, depthmap crowd aggregation simulation), demonstrating a strong feature of data support.
